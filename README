This project is a partial solution to the Triangle kata described by 
Llewellyn Falco (@LlewellynFalco) in 
http://www.slideshare.net/llewellynfalco/test-drivendevelopment-fluency

The test cases follows the 10 steps described on slide 4. 

Although it's a good demo of test-driven development, it's still missing 
a lot of test cases to make this a serious set of test cases. Currently, 
there are 10 methods (each corresponding to one of the 10 steps) and all 
of them use a 3-4-5 triangle with the right angle at the origin. 

Test cases that I would add

* Check that all three angles add to 180 degrees
* Other kinds of triangles, e.g. equilateral, scalene, isosoles, degenerate
* Triangles with negative vectors
* Sides that have 0 length
* Co-linear sides
* Either add getters and setters to all classes OR make the fields final

* Passing null pointers
* Dealing with invalid input (with exceptions?)
* Have getPoints and getSides throw exceptions on errors

* Point.isEquals uses simple == operator. Should probably allow points within
epsilon, because the x and y coordinates are doubles
